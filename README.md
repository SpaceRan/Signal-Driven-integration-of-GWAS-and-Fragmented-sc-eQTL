# Signal-Driven Integration of GWAS and Fragmented sc-eQTL Data

Conventional colocalization methods (e.g., COLOC) assume complete SNP coverage, consistent linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure, and homogeneous variant representation across datasets, which is rarely satisfied in cross-study integration of single-cell eQTL (sc-eQTL) data. To address this, we launched a signal-driven integrative variant prioritization framework designed to operate under the realistic constraints of fragmented single-cell eQTL data.

## 📢 Current Status

- ✅ All core Python scripts are uploaded and fully functional.
- ✅ The overall workflow logic is clearly structured and reproducible.
- ⚠️ Example datasets and toy runs are **not yet included**.
- ✅ Per-script documentation and usage tutorials will be added shortly.

We are actively preparing standardized test cases and example configurations to facilitate reuse and validation.
